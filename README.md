# IISD-ELA 2023 Hackathon Datasets Repository
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the IISD-ELA 2023 Hackathon Datasets Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for all the datasets that can be used to solve the three IISD-ELA Hackathon 2023 challenges. Because each dataset was prepared with a specific challenge in mind, we have included dataset recommendations for each challenge in the **Challenges and Recommended Datasets** section of this file. However, although these recommendations can be useful, you are free to use any dataset from this repository that may align with your project goals. Moreover, brief metadata for each dataset can be found in the [Just the metadata tables from the excel file Thomas sent] workbook and the datasets themselves can be found in the [dataset pdf file] file, both in this repository.

## Challenges and Recommended Datasets
### Challenge 1: Freshwater Health Assessment App
| Challenge Statement | Problem Holder | 
| ------------------- | -------------- | 
| Thanks to the hard work of many volunteers, to advances in environmental monitoring tools, and to the proliferation of open data, communities now have access to reliable water quality data on many lakes, streams, and watersheds. However, many do not have the contextual knowledge needed to make sense of it. Communities need an intuitive tool to help them to understand the health and immediate threats to their freshwater systems (be it a single lake, or an entire watershed) using either private or public data. | Grand Council Treaty 3 |

### Challenge 2: Water Sampler's Targetting App
| Challenge Statement | Problem Holder | 
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Many watersheds flow year-round and can span hundreds of kilometers, so it's not possible for a single organization to monitor all sites of potential interest. Instead, local Community-Based Monitoring groups (CBMs) often seek to contribute to a larger body of available data collected by a range of other organizations. However, their access to equipment and staff is limited. CBMs need a tool that will help them to identify nearby monitoring programs - with complementary monitoring objectives â€“ to share resources, increase their collective capacity and to highlight gaps in the available data. With this improved understanding of local resources, capacity, and data gaps, CBMs will be able to better coordinate their efforts with their peers and achieve impactful monitoring at a watershed scale.	| Living Lakes Canada	 |

### Challenge 3: Data Dashboard Builder
| Challenge Statement | Problem Holder | 
| ------------------- | -------------- | 
| There are large volumes of high-quality data (including some  ELA data!) available to the public on repositories like DataStream, but they can be overwhelming to work with. In addition, models and data visualizations are an important part of environmental reporting and advocacy, but these flashy products can be technically challenging and time-consuming to generate. There is a need for an intuitive tool that enables citizen scientists to ask questions and model or visualize the answers, to be published and disseminated to others in the environmental community. | ACAP Saint John |
