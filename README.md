# IISD-ELA 2023 Hackathon Datasets Repository
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the IISD-ELA 2023 Hackathon Datasets Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for all the datasets that can be used to solve the three IISD-ELA Hackathon 2023 challenges. Because each dataset was prepared with a specific challenge in mind, we have included dataset recommendations for each challenge in the **Challenges and Recommended Datasets** section of this file. However, although these recommendations can be useful, you are free to use any dataset from this repository that may align with your project goals. The metadata for each dataset can be found in the "ELAHackathon_Metadata_2023.csv" file in this repository, which contains relevant information such as site location and parameters, as well as where to find the datasets. The datasets themselves are located in this repository's "Hackathon Datasets" folder. Before you start, please carefully read the rest of this document for relevant information such as our judging criteria, terms of use, and dataset citation.

## Challenges and Recommended Datasets
### Challenge 1: Freshwater Health Assessment App
| Challenge Statement | Problem Holder | 
| ------------------- | -------------- | 
| Thanks to the hard work of many volunteers, to advances in environmental monitoring tools, and to the proliferation of open data, communities now have access to reliable water quality data on many lakes, streams, and watersheds. However, many do not have the contextual knowledge needed to make sense of it. Communities need an intuitive tool to help them to understand the health and immediate threats to their freshwater systems (be it a single lake, or an entire watershed) using either private or public data. | Grand Council Treaty 3 |

#### Recommended Datasets
- GCT3 water quality samples 2023
-  NWT CBM Data

-  Open Canada - Surficial Geology - Geospatial Data & Metadata (needs GIS software to work with it)
-  NRCAN Geoscan - Surficial Geology of Canada - Map Image/PDF & Metadata

### Challenge 2: Water Sampler's Targetting App
| Challenge Statement | Problem Holder | 
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Many year-round-flowing watersheds can be vast, making it impossible for a single organization to monitor all potential sites. Local Community-Based Monitoring groups (CBMs) aim to contribute to a larger pool of data from various organizations but often face equipment and staff limitations. They require a tool to identify nearby monitoring programs with similar objectives, enabling resource sharing, enhancing collective capacity, and pinpointing data gaps. This will help CBMs coordinate efforts, leading to more impactful watershed-scale monitoring.	| Living Lakes Canada	 |

### Challenge 3: Data Dashboard Builder
| Challenge Statement | Problem Holder | 
| ------------------- | -------------- | 
| There are large volumes of high-quality data (including some  ELA data!) available to the public on repositories like DataStream, but they can be overwhelming to work with. In addition, models and data visualizations are an important part of environmental reporting and advocacy, but these flashy products can be technically challenging and time-consuming to generate. There is a need for an intuitive tool that enables citizen scientists to ask questions and model or visualize the answers, to be published and disseminated to others in the environmental community. | ACAP Saint John |
